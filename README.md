# Fake-News-Chaeckin-with-Python
 In this project  we have implemented python program to get news contents from different online news APIs using request library and collect all the news content and store in a data base to use for detecting possible fake news.
Afterwards we used Logistic Regression  for training on the features extracted from the news contents from the database using stemming from nltk and Tfidf from sklearn.
